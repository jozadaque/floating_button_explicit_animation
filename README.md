# Floating Button Explicit Animation

This project is an Explicit animation learning exercise using Tweens that was carried out within the Masterclass course - Basic Flutter.

## About this Project

This project consists of a challenge to create a round button located in the lower right part of the device's screen that, when clicked, moves to the upper part of the center, transforming itself into a rectangle.
This project aims to practice the knowledge acquired in the masterclass classes and in the Flutter documentation.
